# G9_ISP-2020
This was my isp in grade 9 all made from processing 3
Note that there is a data file that is required for the code to run
also very important thing you need to get the java sound library
Now to use the program just paste the 3 source codes into 3 classes all differently named

Tbh it could be better im just putting the code here as a storage area ig
dont copy this pls but take i n s p i r a t i o n  :)
